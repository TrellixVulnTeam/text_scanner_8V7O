{$strong}OPTION #2{$strongEnd}: Call your credit card company to find out why the payment was declined. Then try paying online again using this link: {$paymentUrl}. Below are some common reasons for declined charges:

1. Credit card limit reached: Check your credit limit. You may have reached your daily or total credit card limit on the day we attempted to charge your card. If this is the case, ask your credit card company to increase your limit.

2. Maximum amount allowed for a single charge exceeded: Check the maximum amount your card can be charged at a single time. If the declined charge is higher than this amount, try asking your credit card company to increase the limit.

3. Maximum number of charges card can receive in a period exceeded: Check how many times your card can be charged in given time period. You can also talk to your bank about increasing this limit or simply wait until your card can be charged again.

4. Card doesn't accept charges from an online source: Make sure your card allows online transactions. If not, talk to your credit card company.

5. Card doesn't allow for international transactions: Make sure that your card can accept international charges. If not, talk to your credit card company.

{$strong}CANADIAN VISA WARNING:{$strongEnd}

I want to warn you that getting a visa to Canada is extremely difficult. Based on our experience, 1 out of every 4 of visa applications to Canada gets rejected. The reason is that Canada's high quality of life attracts many immigrants, including illegal immigrants. The task of the officers working at the Canadian Consulate is to obtain conclusive evidence that there is absolutely no intention of illegal immigration.

You have a good chance of getting a Canadian visa only if you have previously been granted a Canadian visa, or if you have a very good reason to study in Canada instead of another country. For example, if your employer sends you to attend a business conference in Canada and you want to take an English course while you're there, that is a good reason. Please be aware that even an invitation from the school is not sufficient proof. The applicant must clearly and convincingly prove why he or she is going to learn English in Canada instead of another country.

Furthermore, the review process for Canadian visa applications takes a long time and can sometimes take up to 8 weeks. In the event of a visa denial, you will lose a substantial amount of money, including but not limited to your {if $son} for your son{/if}{if $daughter} for your daughter{/if}{if $child} for your child{/if}{if $children} for your children{/if}{if $brother} for your brother{/if}{if $sister} for your sister{/if}{if $mother} for your mother{/if}{if $father} for your father{/if}{if $cousin} for your cousin{/if}{if $husband} for your husband{/if}{if $wife} for your wife{/if}{if $niece} for your niece{/if}{if $nephew} for your nephew{/if}{if $friend} for your friend{/if}{if $boyfriend} for your boyfriend{/if}{if $girlfriend} for your girlfriend{/if}{if $student} for your student{/if}{if $students} for your students{/if}{if $relative} for your relative{/if}{if $grandmother} for your grandmother{/if}{if $grandfather} for your grandfather{/if}{if $granddaughter} for your granddaughter{/if}{if $grandson} for your grandson{/if}{if $uncle} for your uncle{/if}{if $aunt} for your aunt{/if}{if $fiance} for your fiance{/if}{if $fiancee} for your fiancee{/if}{if $family} for your family{/if}visa application fees, school registration fee, express mail fee for your {if $son} for your son{/if}{if $daughter} for your daughter{/if}{if $child} for your child{/if}{if $children} for your children{/if}{if $brother} for your brother{/if}{if $sister} for your sister{/if}{if $mother} for your mother{/if}{if $father} for your father{/if}{if $cousin} for your cousin{/if}{if $husband} for your husband{/if}{if $wife} for your wife{/if}{if $niece} for your niece{/if}{if $nephew} for your nephew{/if}{if $friend} for your friend{/if}{if $boyfriend} for your boyfriend{/if}{if $girlfriend} for your girlfriend{/if}{if $student} for your student{/if}{if $students} for your students{/if}{if $relative} for your relative{/if}{if $grandmother} for your grandmother{/if}{if $grandfather} for your grandfather{/if}{if $granddaughter} for your granddaughter{/if}{if $grandson} for your grandson{/if}{if $uncle} for your uncle{/if}{if $aunt} for your aunt{/if}{if $fiance} for your fiance{/if}{if $fiancee} for your fiancee{/if}{if $family} for your family{/if}visa documents, bank or credit card fee for your {if $son} for your son{/if}{if $daughter} for your daughter{/if}{if $child} for your child{/if}{if $children} for your children{/if}{if $brother} for your brother{/if}{if $sister} for your sister{/if}{if $mother} for your mother{/if}{if $father} for your father{/if}{if $cousin} for your cousin{/if}{if $husband} for your husband{/if}{if $wife} for your wife{/if}{if $niece} for your niece{/if}{if $nephew} for your nephew{/if}{if $friend} for your friend{/if}{if $boyfriend} for your boyfriend{/if}{if $girlfriend} for your girlfriend{/if}{if $student} for your student{/if}{if $students} for your students{/if}{if $relative} for your relative{/if}{if $grandmother} for your grandmother{/if}{if $grandfather} for your grandfather{/if}{if $granddaughter} for your granddaughter{/if}{if $grandson} for your grandson{/if}{if $uncle} for your uncle{/if}{if $aunt} for your aunt{/if}{if $fiance} for your fiance{/if}{if $fiancee} for your fiancee{/if}{if $family} for your family{/if}course, and other non-refundable cancellation charges. You can view our sales and refund policy here: http://www.languageinternational.com/sales-and-refund-policy

Because of these reasons, we recommend that you choose another school in another country instead of Canada. For example, visas to Malta, the US, or the UK are generally easier and faster to get. 9 out of 10 students get their visas to these countries. You can find English courses in these locations on our website: http://www.languageinternational.com/english-courses

{$strong}UK VISA INFORMATION:{$strongEnd}

{$firstName}, do you already have a long-term visa to the UK? If not, can you reduce your duration from {$duration} to 48 weeks? The maximum duration for a "Short-Term Study Visa" is 11 months (48 weeks).

Alternatively, you can also apply for a "Tier 4 General Student Visa (GSV)", which allows you to study in the UK for more than 11 months. However, the visa application process is a lot more complicated. This visa is typically only issued for students enrolled in a university.

Almost all of our students attending English language courses apply for the Short-Term Study Visa, so I would recommend that you apply for this type too. Your visa support document will be sent to you after we receive full payment for your course.

The school cannot provide you with any visa supporting documents{if $son} for your son{/if}{if $daughter} for your daughter{/if}{if $child} for your child{/if}{if $children} for your children{/if}{if $brother} for your brother{/if}{if $sister} for your sister{/if}{if $mother} for your mother{/if}{if $father} for your father{/if}{if $cousin} for your cousin{/if}{if $husband} for your husband{/if}{if $wife} for your wife{/if}{if $niece} for your niece{/if}{if $nephew} for your nephew{/if}{if $friend} for your friend{/if}{if $boyfriend} for your boyfriend{/if}{if $girlfriend} for your girlfriend{/if}{if $student} for your student{/if}{if $students} for your students{/if}{if $relative} for your relative{/if}{if $grandmother} for your grandmother{/if}{if $grandfather} for your grandfather{/if}{if $granddaughter} for your granddaughter{/if}{if $grandson} for your grandson{/if}{if $uncle} for your uncle{/if}{if $aunt} for your aunt{/if}{if $fiance} for your fiance{/if}{if $fiancee} for your fiancee{/if}{if $family} for your family{/if}.

The reason is that Ireland's high quality of life attracts many immigrants, including illegal immigrants. The task of the officers working at the Irish border is to obtain conclusive evidence that there is absolutely no intention of illegal immigration or any plan to work in Ireland. You have a good chance of being allowed into the country if you have booked a full-time language course with at least 15 lessons per week.

{$firstName}, I also see that you are{if $hasCitizenship} from {$citizenship}{/if}{if !$hasCitizenship}{if $hasCountryResidence} from {$countryResidence}{/if}{/if} and therefore need an F-1 student visa to study here in the United States. Students from {$countryResidence} can study in the United States on either a B1/B2 tourist visa or an F-1 student visa. It is much easier to get an F-1 student visa because the school can help you with your visa application.

{$strong}JAPAN VISA INFORMATION:{$strongEnd}

If you want to study in Japan for 6 months or more, you have to apply for a student visa. 

Getting a student visa takes up to 5 months. Japanese immigration gives student visas only 4 times a year: for the January term, April term, July term and October term. They are also very strict with the application deadline. If you are late even for just 1 day, they will not accept your application.

To apply for a student visa, the school needs to collect all the required documents from you, complete the application documents in Japanese, and go to the immigration to apply for your student visa before the deadline. Therefore, the school needs to receive your enrollment at least 1 month before the immigration deadline.

{$strong}{if $january}In your case, the next possible start date is in July. The visa application deadline for the July term is in March. {/if}{if $february}In your case, the next possible start date is in July.

1. Full payment (by credit card or bank transfer)
2. Proof of identification (your passport)

4. Proof of employment (a letter from your employer, if you are working)
5. Proof of bank balance and income (either yours or your financial sponsor's)

{if $startingInLessThan180days}

{$strong}ALTERNATIVE TO GETTING A STUDENT VISA NOW:{$strongEnd}

If you would like to study for 6 months or more and would like to start as soon as possible, you can first apply for and enter Japan with a tourist visa. When you arrive in Japan, you can change your visa status to a student visa. However, you must study for at least 6 months from the day you receive your student visa.

For example, the student can start a course in October under a tourist visa. The student needs to go to the Japanese embassy to get a tourist visa. The student can then change the visa status to a student visa, but the student has to collect the required documents and send them to the school to get a student visa valid from January onwards. 

In this example, because the student needs to study for at least 6 months with a student visa, the student has to study from January for at least 6 more months. In total, the student has to study for 9 months in this case.

{$strong}CHINA VISA INFORMATION:{$strongEnd}

Please be aware that language schools in China are NOT authorized to issue the JW201 or JW202 form that is normally required to apply for an X2 or X1 student visa. Only universities in China are authorized to issue these forms. However, based on our experience, the Chinese embassy grants X2 or X2 student visas to our students with a letter of acceptance from the school, even without the JW201 or JW202 form.

You have three options for studying in China:

1. {$strong}L tourist visa{$strongEnd} (for tourists who want to study for {$strong}up to 30 days{$strongEnd}) - You must apply for an L tourist visa on your own, without the help of the school.

2. {$strong}X2 student visa{$strongEnd} (for short-term students who want to study for {$strong}less than 180 days{$strongEnd}) - After we receive full payment for the course, the school will send you a letter of acceptance to support your X2 student visa application. Students with an X2 visa must stay in China within the duration period as indicated on the visa. It is not necessary to apply for a temporary residence permit upon arrival in China. 

3. {$strong}X1 student visa{$strongEnd} (for long-term students who want to study for {$strong}180 days or more{$strongEnd}) - After we receive full payment for the course, the school will send you a letter of acceptance to support your student visa application.{if $moreThan25Weeks} Please note that the Chinese X1 student visa will only get you into China, but not allow you to stay there. X1 visa holders must apply for a temporary residence permit from the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) within 30 days upon entry into China. The temporary residence permit can be issued with validity of 180 days to 5 years. 


For students with an X1 visa, here are the steps to apply for the visa and the temporary residence permit:

1. Register and pay for your course. You can pay for the course by credit card or by bank transfer.

2. Wait for the school to send you a JW201 or JW202 form and a letter of acceptance to support your X1 or X2 student visa application.

3. Apply for a student visa with the documents sent to you by your school (JW101 or JW202 and acceptance letter) at a Chinese embassy near you – it need not be in your home country. Make sure they take photocopies and give back the originals. This is important – you need them when you get to China.

4. Within 1 - 2 days of your arrival in China, register at your school. The school will provide you with documentation showing that the school is accredited and that you are enrolled and have paid the fees. The school will also provide you with the address of a local clinic where you can get your medical exam done.

5. After registering at your school, go to a local clinic to get your medical exam done.

6. Go to to the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) to apply for your residence permit. The school will usually have filled the majority of the form out and you just have to worry about filling in your name, passport number and signing it. A one-year residence permit costs 400RMB and usually takes 3 working days to process. You pay on the day you collect.

Students are not permitted to work on the X type visa. International students in China are most likely to get fined for illegally working, not applying for the residence permit in time, or overstaying their residence permit. In addition to fines, all offenses carry the risk of deportation.

You can be fined up to 500RMB a day, with an overall limit of 10,000RMB. Make sure you book your flight home before your visa expires. You might think a few days won’t matter but the authorities certainly won’t see it that way.

Also, if you have any special requests (dietary restrictions, allergies, or anything like that), please let me know, so that we can take it into account when selecting the teacher with whom you will be living and studying.
